package accessibility

// Redact returns a copy of a tree with the values that must not leave the
// process removed. It is the single implementation of that rule, shared by
// everything that carries a tree outward — the automation socket and session
// recordings — so the two cannot drift apart.
//
// Sensitive nodes always lose their value and description, whatever the
// caller asks for: a widget that marks itself sensitive is supposed to leave
// Value empty, and clearing it again here means one that forgets does not
// leak. Input nodes lose their value unless exposeInputValues is set, because
// a text field is where users type things an application did not think to
// mark secret.
//
// The input tree is not modified. It belongs to the frame that produced it.
